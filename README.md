# AdventOfCode2022

This is code for the challenge at https://adventofcode.com/

Challenges start out fairly simple and get more challening. I am teaching myself Python in a haphazard manner while avoiding studying for the CISSP exam.
I have no previous experience in Python, but I have taken courses in C++ and Java and used VBScript at work.
